Vantage uses a mechanism called a \"Cross Account IAM Role\" to interact with services in your AWS account. AWS has publicly documented this method and officially recommends it as the preferred method of doing any cross account interactions on AWS. Numerous internal AWS services and systems also leverage this method. This means that Vantage never needs access credentials, account logins or passwords. Note that everyone who works at Vantage has previously worked in public cloud infrastructure including companies like AWS, DigitalOcean, Github, Akamai and Cloudflare and we are taking best practices learned at those companies into consideration when building Vantage. Read Only by Default When you create a Cross Account IAM Role using the provided CloudFormation template you are giving Vantage various permissions . All of the permissions by default are ReadOnly. The list of permissions was created by using the official AWS ReadOnly policy and removing some of the permissions AWS includes in that list in order to prevent Vantage from seeing information like reading from S3 Buckets and reading from databases. Vantage only collects metadata about your infrastructure and never even attempts to read sensitive information from the underlying services. Our CloudFormation template is public and you may audit the list of permissions here . Opting into Write Actions Vantage currently supports a limited subset of write, update and delete actions. When you attempt to perform these actions with Vantage, Vantage will determine what IAM permissions it needs to complete those actions and request them accordingly. It will always be at your discretion to opt into these actions. You may also choose to never use Vantage for write actions. Connecting Multiple AWS Accounts Vantage allows you to connect multiple AWS accounts. We advise that you connect your master AWS account first. By default, we require you to start with one AWS account and ensure it properly connected. Upon connecting a master AWS account, Vantage will profile for all member accounts present in the organization. Vantage will be able to show you accrued costs from all member accounts in the organization as well as active resources that are present in that master AWS account . In the event that you have multiple member accounts and want to view Active Resources present in those accounts, Vantage will offer you the ability to run something called a CloudFormation StackSet that will create one role per AWS member account. You're also welcome to skip this step and add/remove AWS accounts from your account settings whenever you see fit. ' We recommend using StackSets if you have several accounts you would like to connect. This will automate the process for all of the accounts in your Organizational Unit. When connecting your account, if you have at least one member account, you will see instructions specific to your account on how to connect your member accounts using StackSets. Connecting with Terraform If you manage your infrastructure with Terraform it is very easy to connect to Vantage. During onboarding, instead of following the CloudFormation process, you can click on the terraform instructions which will give you the proper IAM Role creation snippets which can be dropped into your Terraform codebase. Once you create the roles you can enter the ARN of the IAM Role which was created to complete the connection process. Connecting by Manually Creating an IAM Role If you would like to create IAM Roles manually or use another tool to manage your infrastructure you can create the necessary cross acccount role. During onboarding, instead of following the Cloudformation process, you can click on the IAM Role option and you will be presented with a Trust Relationship and an Inline Policy that are required for the role. After creating the role, return to the onboarding page to submit the ARN of the created role to complete the connection.","title":"Connecting Your Account"},{"location":"connecting/#setup","text":"","title":"Setup"},{"location":"connecting/#connecting-your-aws-account","text":"Vantage understands security concerns and aims to provide as secure of a connection as possible with your AWS accounts.

By default, Vantage provides you with a Cost Report named \"All Resources\" that will show you all costs across all AWS member accounts, regions, services and tags. You can create as many Cost Reports as you'd like to filter your costs by any of the aforementioned dimensions. Many customers typically setup one Cost Report per AWS tag that their team has defined to see costs for certain components of their application. Below is an example of what a Cost Report will look like after you have connected your account. Filtering Cost Reports Cost Reports allow you to see your costs grouped by AWS Service in descending order of accrued costs. By clicking AWS Service rows in the table below, the graph will update with just costs for that specific AWS Service. You may also click the AWS Service name link to see subcategory costs which is described in the next section. AWS Service Subcategory Costs Each AWS Service typically has multiple underlying subcategory costs. For example, in the main cost report table view you'll see all of your S3 Costs in aggregate. However, S3 charges on a number of different subcategories like the amount of storage you've used, the amount of egress traffic for retrieving S3 Objects and for the actual HTTP requests you make to query for S3 Objects. By clicking an AWS service name from the main Cost Report table, you can see a full breakdown of all subcategory costs that comprise that main AWS service cost. Below is an example of subcategory costs for EC2-Other which includes subcategory costs for EBS Volumes, data transfer and more. When supported and resources are present, Vantage will also show you the Active Resources contributing to these subcategory costs.","title":"Cost Reports"},{"location":"cost_reports/#filtering-cost-reports","text":"Cost Reports allow you to see your costs grouped by AWS Service in descending order of accrued costs.

These forecasts are based off of your account's actual cost data and produced from a Vantage-developed machine learning model that is trained anonymously from all Vantage customers to be as accurate as possible. Vantage gives a range of an upper-expected-band and a lower-expected-band with a median forecast that is the middle of these two ranges. This forecast is updated daily as new cost data arrives. Below is a picture of an example Cost Forecast. AWS Service Forecasts In addition to seeing forecasts in aggregate for Cost Reports, you can also see a per AWS service cost forecast by clicking the rows in the table below. This will show you forecasts for each individual AWS service. Forecast Generation Forecasts take some time to generate - typically within 10 minutes but is dependent on the amount of data composing a Cost Report. If you don't see a forecast being generated temporarily after creating your account or creating a new Cost Report check back in after about 10-15 minutes and it should appear. Forecasts for Member Accounts, Tags, or Regions Forecasts are generated for every Cost Report . As a result, if you would like to see a forecast for a specific member account, tag or region you can simply create a Cost Report with the dimensions you desire and a forecast will be generated accordingly.","title":"Forecasting"},{"location":"forecasting/#aws-service-forecasts","text":"In addition to seeing forecasts in aggregate for Cost Reports, you can also see a per AWS service cost forecast by clicking the rows in the table below.

This allows teams to easily understand how their shared clusters are being utilized and how to account for cluster costs across teams and applications. How it works Vantage calculates the cost of a running POD by taking the reserved CPU and Memory along with the actually used CPU and Memory and multiplying it by the cost to use a single core and single GB of RAM on a specific type of EC2 Instance. Enabling Kubernetes Costs In order to enable Kubernetes costs visit your Workspace settings page and click into Integrations. From there you will see all of the EKS Clusters currently running in your account along with the status of the Integration.

We as developers on Vantage are also customers of Vantage to more closely align our security concerns with those of our customers. Lastly, our team has worked at public cloud infrastructure providers including Amazon Web Services and DigitalOcean and are applying best practices learned at these providers to ensure security is handled as best it can. Cross Account IAM Roles Vantage leverages something called Cross Account IAM Roles to sync information about your infrastructure resources. This means we don't store sensitive information like account access keys and access key secrets to use Vantage. This method is the AWS recommended approach and is detailed in depth by AWS here for you to learn more. When you grant access to your AWS account to Vantage by running the provided CloudFormation stack, it creates a cross account role with in-line policies selected by Vantage. These policies are a trimmed down version of the policies in the AWS-managed \"ReadOnlyAccess\" policy but we've removed actions that would otherwise allow us to access sensitive information in databases, buckets and certain services. Our CloudFormation template is open source and hosted publicly here for transparency. Should you have any other questions please feel free to email us at security@vantage.sh. Customizing Cross Account Role Permissions Vantage requests various in-line read-only permissions when creating the cross account role on your behalf. However, we understand this can be too broad of a permission set for certain use-cases. As a result, we do allow for creating Cross Account IAM roles with whatever permissions you're comfortable with. It is important to understand that as a result of narrowing the scope of the permissions Vantage has certain functionality that will be limited. If you email support@vantage.sh in advance of that we are happy to facilite provisioning your account with a custom role prior to then. Please note that we will provide you with some custom attributes to associate with your Cross Account Role to prevent against the Confused Deputy problem so please contact Vantage support prior to creating your role. Data Caching Data about your cloud infrastructure is cached on Vantage's production infrastructure. We do this in order to provide a fast and user-friendly experience. We do not cache all information about your cloud infrastructure. In the event you remove your account with Vantage, we delete all corresponding data from our databases. All data is encrypted at rest and in transit wherever possible. Data Revocation In your account settings page you have the ability to revoke the Cross Account IAM Role at any time. Automatically and nearly instantly, Vantage will delete all data associated with that Cross Account IAM Role. It doesn't remove your set of custom Vantage Views created - however all of those views will be empty as there are no resources. In your account settings page you also have the ability to delete your account. Upon deleting your account all data is deleted. Team Security Everyone on our team has spent time working at a major cloud infrastructure provider and is well versed in cloud security. We ensure the bare minimum of team members have access to our own AWS cloud infrastructure. Currently the number of team members with access is only two people.

Without any action necessary by you, Vantage will determine what resources have been deleted, added and changed and represent them in the Vantage console accordingly. We are sensitive to our impact on AWS API limits and have done considerable work on minimizing the amount of API requests we make to limit impact. That being said, we haven't had a single user mention concerns with API calls we make. In the navigation bar at the top of the Vantage console you'll see a refresh icon available to you. When you hover over that refresh icon, Vantage will inform you when the time a sync took place. Manual Syncing In the event that you're making changes to your infrastructure, it's very common that you'll need to refresh the state with Vantage prior to the one hour interval taking place. To issue a manual account sync, you simply need to click the refresh icon in the top right of the navigation bar. The refresh icon will begin rotating signalling that the sync is in progress. When the sync is complete, the icon will stop rotating. You may need to refresh the page you're currently on to get the latest information after the sync has occured. When you issue a sync, Vantage will do a global inspection across all AWS regions and services and perform the following: Add new AWS resources in the Vantage console that are newly added.

Without any action necessary by you, Vantage will determine what resources have been deleted, added and changed and represent them in the Vantage console accordingly. We are sensitive to our impact on AWS API limits and have done considerable work on minimizing the amount of API requests we make to limit impact. That being said, we haven't had a single user mention concerns with API calls we make. In the navigation bar at the top of the Vantage console you'll see a refresh icon available to you.

To issue a manual account sync, you simply need to click the refresh icon in the top right of the navigation bar. The refresh icon will begin rotating signalling that the sync is in progress. When the sync is complete, the icon will stop rotating. You may need to refresh the page you're currently on to get the latest information after the sync has occured.

Active Resources are meant to give you a simple way for seeing what active resources are present in your AWS account. Note that we can only show active resources for accounts for which there is a connected IAM Role -- but you can connect as many member accounts as you'd like to see resources present from them. Active Resource Pricing Vantage maintains an ever-growing and always-updating AWS pricing database. As Vantage finds active resources, it will find the corresponding rate for the resource to show you an approximate run-rate cost. For things like EC2 Instances, we will profile for the instance type being used, what region its in and apply the proper rate for its lifecycle (on-demand, spot, etc). We also show an approximate monthly run-rate which extrapolates this hourly rate out for the given month. Actively being worked on in our roadmap is also showing actual accrued costs per AWS Resource so not only will you see a rough run-rate but you'll be able to see actual accrued costs per AWS resource soon as well. Active Resources and Syncing Vantage periodically syncs your account and you may also manually issue a sync from the top navigation bar. Whenever a sync occurs, Vantage will automatically determine what Active Resources are present globally across all supported services and represent them accordingly in the Vantage console. If you make an immediate change to your infrastructure and want to see its impact in Vantage simply issue a sync manually and the changes will be picked up accordingly. Multiple AWS Account Support As you add multiple roles for supporting active resources from multiple AWS accounts, Vantage will display them accordingly in Active Resource views. As resources are imported across multiple AWS accounts, Vantage will also show which AWS account the resources are in.","title":"Active Resources"},{"location":"views/#active-resource-pricing","text":"Vantage maintains an ever-growing and always-updating AWS pricing database.

When your Vantage account is created you are assigned a \"Default\" workspace but you have the ability to create multiple workspaces. Each workspace is a logical grouping of AWS accounts and has its own respective set of views. There are two main use-cases we see for customers leveraging workspaces on Vantage. Grouping resources together across AWS accounts : One customer on AWS sometimes has multiple AWS accounts for the same company. Vantage customers will use a single workspace to group multiple AWS accounts together to view all resources in the same console and views. Context Switching Between AWS Accounts : Some customers (such as indepedendent contractors) will create a workspace per customer of theirs. This allows them to quickly do discovery of the resources in that AWS account and level set for assisting those customers and context switch between accounts quickly while keeping respective views and resources separate. When you have more than one workspace in your Vantage account a workspace menu will appear in your navigation menu for you to switch between workspaces. Workspaces are also represented on your account page for you to view, add AWS accounts to and delete whenever you'd like. Please note the restrictions on AWS account limits per Vantage account on the pricing page .","title":"Workspaces"}]}
