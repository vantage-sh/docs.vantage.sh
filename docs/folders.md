# Folders

If your organization has many Cost Reports, you can create folders to separate Cost Reports for different groups, like business units or cost centers. You can also move Cost Reports between folders and nest folders within each other to create complex organizational structures.

## Create a Folder

1. From the top navigation, click **Cost Reporting**.
2. On the left menu, select **Cost Reports**.
3. On the top right, click the down arrow next to **+ New**.
4. Select **New Folder**.
5. Enter a name for the folder, then click **Create**.
6. The new folder is displayed in the Cost Report list. Select the folder to open it.
7. At the top of the folder, click the down arrow next to **+ New**. You can create a new Cost Report inside the folder or a sub-folder within that folder.

## Move Cost Reports and Folders

To move one or more folders or Cost Reports from the All Cost Reports screen:

1. From the All Cost Reports screen, select the checkbox next to one or more Cost Reports or folders.
2. At the top of the report list, click **Move**.
3. Select any listed folder, then click **Move Here**.

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", boxShadow: "0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)", borderRadius: "10px", overflow: "hidden" }}>

</div>

:::note
When you move a folder into another folder, it becomes a subfolder. Consequently, any reports or folders contained within the moved folder will move along with it.

To move one or more Cost Reports or subfolders out of a folder and back to the main All Cost Reports screen:

1. From the current folder, select the checkbox next to one or more Cost Reports or folders.
2. At the top of the report list, click **Move**.
3. The **Moving...** modal is displayed. Click **< Back** until **All Reports (currently selected)** is displayed at the top.
4. Click **Move Here**.

## Create a Dashboard from a Folder

You can create a [dashboard](/dashboards) made up of all the reports within a folder.

1. Navigate to any folder.
2. At the top, click **Dashboard**. A dashboard containing all included reports is displayed.
3. If you want to save the dashboard, click **Save As New**. This saved dashboard will be shareable and available within the main **Dashboards** screen.
