# Dashboards

Dashboards contain a set of [Cost Reports](/cost_reports), [segment reports](/segments), [resource reports](/active_resources), or [financial commitment reports](/financial_commitment_reports). You can apply date range and period filters (e.g., display daily costs) to all reports on the dashboard. A consistent date range across all reports on the dashboard can help with cost comparison between different reports. You can assign any number of reports to a dashboard, regardless of which folder the report is in. Once a dashboard is created, you can modify the name and date settings as well as add/remove reports from the dashboard.

To get started with Dashboards, you can also watch these video demos on [Vantage University](/vantage_university_cost_reporting) üéì.

You can add the following widget types to dashboards:

- [Cost Reports](/cost_reports)
- [Usage Reports](/usage_based_reporting)
- [Active Resource Reports](/active_resources)
- [Kubernetes Efficiency Reports](/kubernetes)
- [Financial Commitment Reports](/financial_commitment_reports)

## Create a Dashboard

1. From the top navigation, click **Cost Reporting**.
2. On the left menu, select **Dashboards**. All existing dashboards are displayed within this view.
3. Click **+ New**.
4. Enter a **Name**.
5. Under **Add Reports**, select the reports you want displayed on the dashboard. Widgets are initially added to dashboards in chronological order, with the most recently added widget appearing at the bottom.
   :::note
   At this time, you cannot add widgets from the Overview page, such as **Provider Summary**.
   :::
6. Click **Save**. Reports are displayed on the dashboard in alphabetical order, by report name.

<div style={{display:"flex", justifyContent:"center"}}>
    <img alt="A dashboard in the console displayed with four different reports" width="70%" src="https://assets.vantage.sh/blog/dashboards/dashboards-2.png" />
</div>

For each displayed report, click **View Report** to open that report outside the dashboard.

### Save a Dashboard to Favorites

To save a dashboard to your favorites, navigate to the [Dashboards](https://console.vantage.sh/dashboards) page, then click the star icon to the right of the **Created On** column. Access your starred dashboard from the **Starred By Me** screen in the left navigation. Dashboards you create are also displayed on the **Created By Me** screen.

### Delete a Dashboard

To delete a dashboard, navigate to the [Dashboards](https://console.vantage.sh/dashboards) page, then click the ellipses to the right of the **Created On** column. Click **Delete**.

## Customize a Dashboard

On the dashboard, you can apply the following customizations:

- To change the date range of all displayed Cost Reports, click **Customize Date**. Select a date range and click **Apply**. On the top right, click **Save Filters** to keep these settings. Click **Clear Filters** on the top left to remove filter updates.
- To change the date grouping, click the **Choose Period** menu. Select either **Cumulative**, **Monthly**, **Weekly**, or **Daily**. On the top right, click **Save Filters** to keep these settings. Click **Clear Filters** on the top left to remove filter updates.
- To create a new dashboard based on an existing dashboard, click the down arrow next to **Save Filters**. Then, click **Save as New**. You can then enter a new dashboard name and add additional customizations.
- To reset each Cost Report back to its original settings, click **Reset**.
- To add more reports to the dashboard or change the dashboard's name, click the pencil icon on the top right of the dashboard.

:::note
The customization options do not apply to folder dashboards, which are designed to be a read-only one-to-one representation of the resources within a folder. These customization options also do not apply to the **Overview** page.

              borderRadius: "10px", 
              width: "100%",
              overflow: "hidden" 
            }}>
            <ReactPlayer 
                playing 
                muted 
                playsinline
                loop
                url='/img/dashboard-reorder-dashboard.mp4'
                alt="The Reorder icon is clicked on the dashboard edit screen and each report is reordered." 
                width="100%"
                height="100%"
            />
          </div>
        </div>
      </li>

  <TabItem value="edit-screen" label="From the Dashboard Edit Screen">
      <ol>
        <li>From the top right of a dashboard, click the pencil icon.</li>
        <li>The list of reports on the dashboard is displayed. Click <strong>Reorder</strong>.</li>

              boxShadow: "0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)", 
              borderRadius: "10px", 
              width: "100%",
              overflow: "hidden" 
            }}>
            <ReactPlayer 
                playing 
                muted 
                playsinline
                loop
                url='/img/dashboard-reorder.mp4'
                alt="The Reorder icon is clicked on the dashboard edit screen and each report is reordered." 
                width="100%"
                height="100%"
            />
          </div>
        </div>
      </li>
    </ol> 
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Add a Saved Filter to a Dashboard {#saved-filter}

You can use [saved filters](/saved_filters) to apply consistent filter logic to multiple Cost Reports on a dashboard. If you have a dashboard of high-level Cost Reports (e.g., filtered only to connected providers or services), and you want to further filter a dashboard to a team or specific category, you can use saved filters on dashboards to quickly apply this logic.

1. From the top right of any dashboard, click the **Saved Filters** dropdown menu.
2. Select one or more saved filters. The filter logic is applied across all Cost Reports on the dashboard.
   :::note
   When you add a saved filter to a dashboard, if a preexisting filter on a Cost Report and the saved filter use the same provider (e.g., both use AWS), "AND" logic is used between each filter set (i.e., show costs where the preexisting filter _AND_ saved filter are true). If the preexisting filter and saved filter use different providers, ‚ÄúOR‚Äù logic is used between each filter set.  
   :::

## Set a Default Dashboard {#default-dashboard}

You can set a default dashboard that's displayed when a user logs in to Vantage and visits `console.vantage.sh`, instead of the [Overview](/overview) screen. This default dashboard can be set for a team or by an individual user. When the user logs in to Vantage, they will be redirected to that dashboard, and will be in the [workspace](/workspaces) that is associated with that dashboard.

:::note

- If a user is a member of a team with a configured default dashboard and also has a personal dashboard configured, the personal dashboard is displayed.
- If a user is a member of two different teams with configured default dashboards, the user will see the default dashboard of the first team they were added to.
  :::

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="team" label="Set Default Dashboard for Team" default>
  <p>A user with <a href="/rbac">Owner-level</a> permissions can set a default dashboard for a team.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>From the top navigation, click <strong>Settings</strong>.</li>
      <li>From the left navigation, under <strong>General Settings</strong>, click <strong>Teams</strong>.</li>
      <li>Under <strong>Default Dashboard</strong>, select the dashboard that should be displayed when a member of the team visits <code>console.vantage.sh</code>. If you want to remove the default dashboard and display the Overview page instead, select <strong>None</strong>.</li> 
      <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
      </ol> 
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="user" label="Set Personal Default Dashboard">
    <ol>
      <li>From the top navigation, click <strong>Settings</strong>.</li>
      <li>From the left navigation, under <strong>Personal Settings</strong>, click <strong>Profile</strong>.</li>

      <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
      </ol> 
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
