<Tip>
**TIP**

If you need help constructing a VQL query, navigate to the [**Financial Commitment Reports**](https://console.vantage.sh/financial_planning/financial_commitment_reports) page and click **New Report**. From the top left, open the **Filters** menu. Create a filter and click the **View as VQL** button at the top of the **Filters** menu to see a filter's VQL representation. You can copy this syntax to use within your API calls.

## Financial Commitment Reports VQL Schema

VQL for Financial Commitment Reports comprises one namespace, `financial_commitments`, which represents the available [filters](/financial_commitment_reports#create-a-financial-commitment-report) on Financial Commitment Reports in the Vantage console. To reference a filter, use the following syntax: `namespace.field` (e.g., `financial_commitments.service`). The following fields are available within the `financial_commitments` namespace.

| Namespace | Field | VQL Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `financial_commitments` | `provider` | `provider = 'aws'` should be added as the first part of each statement |
| `financial_commitments` | `service` | [Service example](/vql_financial_commitment_report#financial-commitments-by-service) |
| `financial_commitments` | `resource_account_id` | [Account example](/vql_financial_commitment_report#financial-commitments-by-specific-account) |
| `financial_commitments` | `provider_account_id` | [Billing Account example](/vql_financial_commitment_report#financial-commitments-by-specific-billing-account) |
| `financial_commitments` | `commitment_type` | [Commitment Type example](/vql_financial_commitment_report#see-specific-commitment-types) |
| `financial_commitments` | `commitment_id` | [Commitment ARN example](/vql_financial_commitment_report#financial-commitments-by-commitment-arn) |
| `financial_commitments` | `cost_type` | [Charge Type example](/vql_financial_commitment_report#financial-commitments-by-charge-type) |
| `financial_commitments` | `cost_category` | [Category example](/vql_financial_commitment_report#financial-commitments-by-category) |
| `financial_commitments` | `cost_sub_category` | [Subcategory example](/vql_financial_commitment_report#financial-commitments-by-subcategory) |
| `financial_commitments` | `instance_type` | [Instance Type example](/vql_financial_commitment_report#financial-commitments-by-instance-types) |
| `financial_commitments` | `Region` | [Region example](/vql_financial_commitment_report#financial-commitments-by-region) |
| `financial_commitments` | `resource_tags` | [Tags example](/vql_financial_commitment_report#financial-commitments-by-tags) |


### Keywords

VQL includes a set of keywords to create complex filter conditions. These keywords function similar to their SQL equivalents. Note that each expression started with `provider = 'aws'`, followed by additional filters.

| Keyword | Description | VQL Sample | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `AND` | Logical AND operator | `(financial_commitments.provider = 'aws' AND (financial_commitments.resource_tags->>'business-metric' = 'us-east-1a') AND (financial_commitments.cost_category = 'Alarm'))` | This example filters for a specific tag and category, where both conditions must be true. |
| `OR` | Logical OR operator | `(financial_commitments.provider = 'aws' AND (financial_commitments.resource_tags->>'business-metric' = 'us-east-1a') AND (financial_commitments.resource_tags->>'business-metric' = 'us-east-1b'))` | This example looks for results associated with two different tags. At least one condition must be true. |
| `!=` | Is not | `(financial_commitments.provider = 'aws' AND (financial_commitments.cost_type != 'Credit'))` | This example looks for results that are any charge type except for `Credit`. |
| `IN` and `NOT IN` | Used to compare against an array/list | `(financial_commitments.provider = 'aws' AND (financial_commitments.resource_tags->>'business-metric' IN ('us-east-1a','us-east-1b','us-east-1c')))` | This example searches for results with the `business-metric` tag key and multiple values.      This same query also works for `NOT IN` where the results are anything matching the tag key except for those particular values: `(financial_commitments.provider = 'aws' AND (financial_commitments.resource_tags->>'business-metric' NOT IN ('us-east-1a','us-east-1b','us-east-1c')))`. |
| `LIKE` and `NOT LIKE` | Performs string comparisons | `(financial_commitments.provider = 'aws' AND (financial_commitments.commitment_id LIKE '%arn:aws:ec2%'))` | This example selects data where the commitment ARN value contains `arn:aws:ec2`, such as `arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:1234`.      This same query also works for `NOT LIKE` where data does not contain a particular string: `(financial_commitments.provider = 'aws' AND (financial_commitments.commitment_id NOT LIKE '%arn:aws:ec2%'))`. |
| `->>` | This operator is used only when constructing queries related to tags | `(financial_commitments.provider = 'aws' AND (financial_commitments.resource_tags->>'environment' = 'staging'))` | This example looks results with the tag name of `environment` and value of `staging`. |

With these operators and keywords, you can construct complex filter conditions in VQL.

## VQL Examples

The following examples cover common use cases for VQL.

```

### Financial Commitments by Specific Account

Filter down to an individual account.

```sql
(financial_commitments.provider = 'aws' AND (financial_commitments.resource_account_id = '123456789012'))
```

### Financial Commitments by Specific Billing Account

Filter down to an individual billing account.

```sql
(financial_commitments.provider = 'aws' AND (financial_commitments.provider_account_id = '123456789012'))
```

### See Specific Commitment Types

Filter out certain commitment types to see everything else.

```sql
(financial_commitments.provider = 'aws' AND (financial_commitments.commitment_type NOT IN ('credit','free')))
```

### Financial Commitments by Commitment ARN

See the impact of specific financial commitments related to EC2 by ARNs.

```sql
(financial_commitments.provider = 'aws' AND (financial_commitments.commitment_id LIKE '%arn:aws:ec2%'))
```

### Financial Commitments by Charge Type

See only usage-related commitments.

```sql
(financial_commitments.provider = 'aws' AND (financial_commitments.cost_type = 'Usage'))
```

### Financial Commitments by Category

All data transfer-related commitments.

```sql
(financial_commitments.provider = 'aws' AND (financial_commitments.cost_category = 'Data Transfer'))
```

### Financial Commitments by Subcategory

Filter for Cloudfront and data transfer egress in APN2.

```sql
(financial_commitments.provider = 'aws' AND (financial_commitments.cost_sub_category IN ('APN2-DataTransfer-Out-Bytes','APN2-CloudFront-Out-Bytes')))
```

### Financial Commitments by Instance Types

Filter from a list of different instance types.

```sql
(financial_commitments.provider = 'aws' AND (financial_commitments.instance_type IN ('c7a.12xlarge','c7gn.large','c7gn.medium')))
```

### Financial Commitments by Region

```sql
(financial_commitments.provider = 'aws' AND (financial_commitments.resource_tags->>'business-metric' IN ('us-east-1a','us-east-1b','us-east-1c')))
```

### Multiple Filters

Complex filter that shows combining two different statements using `OR` with multiple criteria.

```sql
(financial_commitments.provider = 'aws' AND (financial_commitments.resource_account_id = '123456789012') AND (financial_commitments.service = 'AmazonEC2')) OR (financial_commitments.provider = 'aws' AND (financial_commitments.resource_account_id = '098765432109') AND (financial_commitments.service = 'AmazonRDS'))
```
