## General Settings

<Info>
**NOTE**

Only Organization Owners can configure organization settings. See the [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](/rbac) documentation for details.
</Info>

From the top navigation bar of the Vantage console, click **Settings**. On the side navigation bar, review the options under **General Settings**.

### Currency Conversion

<Info>
**NOTE**

At this time, presentational currency conversion is available only on Vantage reports, such as Cost Reports, Kubernetes Efficiency Reports, Financial Commitment Reports, and Provider Resource Reports. It is also available on Budgets. Additional scopes will be added soon.
</Info>

Vantage offers two options for displaying currency within the console: a *Display Preference* and *Currency Conversion*.

- **Display Preference**: If your imported costs are already billed in a currency other than USD, you can enable a *Display Preference*. This lets you view your costs with the appropriate currency symbol—without using Vantage's currency conversion rates. This option is ideal for users who prefer their costs to reflect the currency in which they are billed.
- **Currency Conversion**: With *Currency Conversion*, you can choose to view costs in a different currency by converting amounts using exchange rates. This is configured per workspace and offers two options:
	- **Previous Month’s Closing Rate**: Uses the closing exchange rate for the last day of the previous month.
	- **Daily Rate**: Applies the current exchange rate for each day.

	Vantage calculates the exchange rate based on a [public API](https://exchangeratesapi.io/).

#### Enable Display Preference

To enable a display preference:

<Steps>
    <Step>
    From the top navigation, click **Settings**
    </Step>
    <Step>
    On the side navigation, click **Workspaces**. All your existing workspaces are displayed. Select the workspace where you want to configure your display preference.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    At the top of the **Workspaces** page, under **Currency Settings > Display Preference**, select your preferred currency from the list. Reports will now display your selected currency symbol next to costs.
    </Step>
</Steps>

#### Enable Currency Conversion

To enable currency conversion:

<Steps>
    <Step>
    From the top navigation, click **Settings**
    </Step>
    <Step>
    On the side navigation, click **Workspaces**. All your existing workspaces are displayed. Select the workspace where you want to enable currency conversion.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        At the top of the **Workspaces** page, under **Currency Settings > Currency Conversion**, select **Enable,** then select your preferred currency from the list.
        <Info>
        **NOTE**

        Anything currently set in the **Display Preference** section is overridden by your currency conversion selection.
        </Info>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        For **Exchange Rate Dates**, select one of the following conversion date options. For the most accurate results, use the currency method in which you are billed:
        - **Daily Rate:** Vantage maintains a daily snapshot of exchange rates to provide estimated currency conversions. With the **Daily Rate** option, the costs' corresponding daily exchange rate will be used for the conversion.
        - **End of Billing Period Rate:** Vantage matches each cost entry to the last date of the corresponding month in which the cost was incurred.
    </Step>
</Steps>

Your settings are automatically saved and available on your reports.

<Info>
**NOTE**

If you disable currency conversion, your presentational currency will default back to USD.

### Create an API Token

You can use the [Vantage API](https://vantage.readme.io/reference/general) to programmatically access cloud pricing data.

#### Create a Vantage API Service Token

Service tokens are associated with an account, not with an individual user. If creating a Service Token for the entire account using the 'Everyone' team, you must have the `Owner` or `Integration Owner` role

<Info>
**NOTE**

All Service Tokens created in non-Enterprise accounts are assigned to the 'Everyone' team.
</Info>

For Enterprise customers who use Teams and Role-Based Access Control, you must also designate a team when creating a Service Token to inherit permissions from. Service Tokens created for Teams outside of the 'Everyone' Team can be done by the `Owner`, `Integration Owner`, and `Editor` role.

<Steps>
    <Step>
    On the left navigation of the **Settings** screen, select **API Access Tokens**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Enter a new token name, choose a team (if applicable), select the **Read** and/or **Write** scope, and click **Create**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Show** to reveal and copy your token.
    </Step>
</Steps>

To revoke a token, click **Delete**.

#### Create a Vantage API Personal Access Token

Personal access tokens are associated with the user who created the token.

To generate an API personal access token:

<Steps>
    <Step>
    On the left navigation of the **Settings** screen, select **API Access Tokens**, then navigate to the **Personal Access Tokens** tab.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Enter a new token name, select the **Read** and/or **Write** scope, and click **Create**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Show** to reveal and copy your token.
    </Step>
</Steps>

To revoke a token, click **Delete**.
