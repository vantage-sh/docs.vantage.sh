Vantage offers a number of native integrations to help you understand all your cloud costs. In addition to integrations within Vantage, you can connect [Custom Providers](/connecting_custom_providers) so that you can monitor costs across your entire tech stack. Vantage also offers app integrations, such as a connection with Jira, so that you can push Vantage alerts and issues directly to your team's native issue-tracking software.

- As a **DevOps Engineer**, you need to consolidate cost data from various cloud providers into a single platform for better visibility. You connect both AWS and GCP, which are your main cloud providers. You also want to view monitoring costs from **Datadog**, which you help to oversee, so you use the native Datadog integration in Vantage to view the total cost impact of your work. You also set up anomaly alerts on Datadog reports and send these alerts to Jira so that the team can triage and work on these issues as soon as they occur.
- As a **FinOps Analyst**, you are very familiar with the FOCUS schema. You currently have a few of your major cloud providers connected to Vantage, but there are some other tools your organization uses that you would like to see displayed alongside those cloud providers. You convert cost and usage reports from these other providers to the schema that's used on Vantage, and based on FOCUS, and use the Custom Providers feature to see costs for your organization's entire tech stack.
