>An organization notices a sudden spike or increase in costs related to a certain service. This service has an attached tag related to a particular team. The manager creates an issue on Vantage for the team to investigate the cost anomaly. The manager can quickly see comments and progress from their team and monitor associated costs on the attached Cost Report.

You can create issues, assign them to members in a workspace, and associate issues with a Cost Report. Team members can comment on issues, adjust an issue's category and status, and estimate the potential cost-savings impact associated with the issue.
