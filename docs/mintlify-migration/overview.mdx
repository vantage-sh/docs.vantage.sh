title: Overview
description: Once you create some provider integrations, Vantage will automatically begin ingesting billing information for your account. The default landing page in the Vantage console is the **Overview** page. This page serves as an executive-level summary, providing a comprehensive snapshot of the cost metrics that matter most to you. Review widgets on the Overview page for high-level cost summaries.

<Info>
**NOTE**

When a user navigates to `console.vantage.sh`, the **Overview** page is displayed. An individual user or owner of a team can configure a default dashboard to be displayed instead of the **Overview** page. See the [Default Dashboards](/dashboards#default-dashboard) documentation for details.

Depending on your provider connections, you will see some of the following widgets:

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Savings Plan Coverage">
    A widget that provides a clear comparison between your total on-demand vs. committed spend. This view helps you understand your expenses for on-demand resources in contrast to cost-saving strategies, like Savings Plans, Reserved Instances, Enterprise Discount Programs, and Committed Use Discounts.
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Provider Summaries">
    Widgets that offer comprehensive cost breakdowns for providers. These widgets provide you with spending insights, displaying the current accrued costs and cost trends compared to the previous month.
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Cost Reports">
    A widget for each one of the [Cost Reports](/cost_reports) you create. One default Cost Report will be present in your account that is referred to as **All Resources**. As you create more Cost Reports in your account, a summary of each Cost Report will automatically show up on the Overview page.
