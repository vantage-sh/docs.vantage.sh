description: "Vantage connects to Coralogix organizations through [gRPC API](https://grpc.io/) calls. After Vantage is authorized to access your Coralogix organization, Vantage will ingest data using the Coralogix [Data Usage Service API](https://coralogix.com/docs/data-usage-service-api/) endpoints. No access is granted to the Coralogix-connected applications. Vantage can see only usage data related to the connected services. <br /><br /> Vantage supports the Logs, Metrics, and Spans services, as well as the [application and subsystem names](https://coralogix.com/docs/application-and-subsystem-names/) for your account. The subsystem name typically refers to the environment (e.g., production, development, or staging). The application name typically refers to the name of the service or applications that send your logs, metrics, and traces. Both the subsystem and application names can be customized, so your values may be different."

**NOTE**

Based on limits imposed by Coralogix, the integration includes 90 days of historical Coralogix usage and cost data.
</Info>

### Next Steps: Manage Workspace Access

Once your costs are imported, select which workspaces this integration is associated with. See the [Workspaces](/workspaces#manage-workspace-provider-integrations) documentation for information.

## Data Refresh

See the [provider data refresh documentation](/provider_data_refresh) for information on when data for each provider refreshes in Vantage.

## Coralogix Reporting Dimensions

On Coralogix [Cost Reports](/cost_reports/), you can filter costs across several dimensions:

- Service (e.g., Logs, Metrics, Spans)
- Category (subsystem name)
- Subcategory (application name)
- Tag ([virtual tags](/tagging) created in Vantage for this provider)
