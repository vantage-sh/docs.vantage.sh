title: "Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)"
---

<Info>
**NOTE**

Advanced role-based access controls are available only for Enterprise tier accounts.
</Info>

Role-based access control (RBAC) facilitates fine-grained management of resource access. Team-based access determines the specific Cost Reporting resources—such as Cost Reports, dashboards, or folders—that a user can view and/or edit.

By default, all users are members of the **Everyone** team. Owners can control which workspaces/resources the Everyone team can access.

The Owner, Team Owner, Team Editor, Team Viewer, and Integration Owner roles are described below.

| Role | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Owner | A global account owner who has full access to all items. This role can also manage teams, integrations, and workspaces within an account. Even if the Everyone team is removed from an item, the Owner will still be able to manage that item. |
| Team Owner | A Team Owner has full control over resources to which that team is granted access. Team Owners also have the ability to change which teams can access their team's resources. They can also manage members of their team. |
| Team Editor | A Team Editor has full control over resources to which that team is granted access; however, they cannot manage the members of the team. |
| Team Viewer | A Team Viewer has read-only access to all resources to which that team is granted access. |
| Integration Owner | This role has all the privileges of the Editor role, as well as the ability to configure and manage access to provider integrations. The role *does not* have access to other administrative settings, like adding and removing users. <br /> • Integration Owners can navigate to the **Settings > Integrations** tab in the Vantage console and manage [provider integrations](/getting_started). <br /> • Only an account Owner can grant the Integration Owner role to another user. <br /> • There is no limit to the number of users that can have this role. <br /> • An Integration Owner has all the privileges of an Editor, as well as integration management privileges. |

## Manage Account Access

Owner is the only role that can invite users to and remove users from Vantage as well as change another user's role.

- On the **General** tab, you can edit the team name and description as well as set a default team [dashboard](/dashboards#default-dashboard).

- On the **Members** tab, you can add and remove members from a team as well as change a member's team role. Only Owners will be able to perform these actions. Additionally, Team Owners can perform these actions for their respective teams.
- On the **Access** tab, Owners and Team Owners can manage workspace access for the team as well as view resources with granted access.
- On the **API Access Tokens** tab, Owners and Team Owners can create [API service tokens](/vantage_account#api-service-token) at the account level that inherit permissions from the team.

![Manage access to a Cost Reporting dashboard](https://assets.vantage.sh/docs/resource-access.png)
</Frame>

<Info>
**NOTE**

You can manage resource-level access from the Cost Reporting navigation list or from directly within a resource. If you are granted access to a report in a workspace outside of your regularly accessed workspace, when you access the link to that report you will have temporary access to the new workspace and can view the items that you were granted access to.
</Info>

<Tip>
**TIP**

If you want to grant access to a resource (for example, a Dashboard) to only a specific team (for example, the Marketing team), set the Everyone team to **Cannot Access**, and set the Marketing team to **Can Access**. See the [Team-Only Resource Access](/rbac#team-only-resource-access) permissions table below.

For instance, if a specific resource from the Marketing workspace, such as a Saved Filter, was shared with the Management team, which has access only to the Management workspace, resetting the access will result in the Management team no longer having access to the Saved Filter.

<Info>
**NOTE**

If a user is on multiple teams that have conflicting permissions, the higher level of permissions will be granted.
</Info>

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Multiple Teams Resource Scenario">
- A user is on the Marketing team with **Team Owner** permissions.
- They are also on the Engineering team with **Team Viewer** permissions.
- Both teams are granted access to a Saved Filter.

The user will be granted Owner-level permissions to that resource, in other words, they can view *and* manage that resource.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Multiple Workspace Access Scenario">
- A user is on the Data Analyst team and the Data Engineering team.
	- The Data Engineering team has **Can Edit** access to the Engineering workspace.
	- The Data Analyst team has **Can View** access to the Engineering workspace.

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Settings Permissions

Settings permissions are relevant to specific functions in the console, including Authentication, Billing & Plans, Integrations, People, Teams, and Workspaces. Only Owners can manage Settings-related functions. Note that Team Owners can manage their team within the Teams UI—but only the team for which they hold the Team Owner role.

<Info>
**NOTE**

Integration Owners can also manage provider integrations; however, they do not have access to additional administrative settings, like workspace configuration or adding/removing users.
</Info>

<Accordion title="Settings Permissions Examples">
- **Scenario 1**: You want to create a new provider integration, such as a new Azure connection. An Owner will need to create the connection.

</Accordion>

## Financial Planning Permissions

Financial planning permissions are relevant to specific screens in the console, including Autopilot, Budgets, Budget Alerts, Business Metrics, Issues, Reserved Instances, Savings Models, and Savings Plans Usage.

Users with the Editor or above role will be able to create resources and manage the above functions.

<Info>
**NOTE**

Any user who is assigned to an [issue](/issues) will have update permissions for that issue.
</Info>

<Accordion title="Financial Planning Permissions Examples">
- **Scenario 1**: You want to create a new Budget Alert. A user with an Editor or above role will need to create and manage the alert. All other users will only be able to *view* the alert.
- **Scenario 2**: Editors and above can create and manage issues. You have a Viewer role and are assigned a new issue. You can now edit and comment on *only this new issue*.
</Accordion>
