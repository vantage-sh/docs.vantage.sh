description: "Vantage connects to your ClickHouse Cloud account via a read-only API key with Developer permissions to ingest ClickHouse usage, costs, and discounts from ClickHouse’s Organization [usageCost API](https://clickhouse.com/docs/cloud/manage/api/usageCost-api-reference). Vantage displays ClickHouse Cloud costs and associated [usage metrics](/usage_based_reporting)."
---

<Info>
**NOTE**

The Clickhouse Organizations usageCost API only supports ClickHouse Cloud and Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC).
</Info>

You can view usage data for ClickHouse Cloud consumption. Usage is measured by the following subcategories:

- Compute
- Storage
- [Data transfer](https://clickhouse.com/docs/cloud/manage/network-data-transfer) (egress over the internet and cross-region)
- [ClickPipes](https://clickhouse.com/docs/integrations/clickpipes)

Usage is measured in ClickHouse Cloud Credits (CHCs), which is a metering unit used by ClickHouse.

<Info>
**NOTE**

You can learn more about CHCs through [ClickHouse Billing documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/cloud/manage/jan-2025-faq/billing).
</Info>

You can integrate multiple ClickHouse Cloud integrations by providing read-only tokens for multiple organizations.
