title: Annotations
description: Annotations add context to events or data points within [Cost Reports](/cost_reports) or [Segment Reports](/segments). The annotation consists of a date and a comment.

## View Corresponding Issues

When an annotation is created, a corresponding [issue](/issues) is also automatically created.

<Steps>
    <Step>
    To open the corresponding issue, click the ellipses (...) on the top right of the annotation.
    </Step>
    <Step>

    <Frame>
    ![View of issue created by an annotation](https://assets.vantage.sh/docs/annotation-issues.png)
    </Frame>
    </Step>
</Steps>

The issue is automatically created with the **Annotation** category label attached and a link to the annotated report. The issue's title will default to the report name and annotation's date. You can use the comment function in the issue to also comment on the annotation.

When an annotation is resolved, the corresponding issue will become a closed issue. Unresolving an issue reopens the corresponding issue.

## Budget Alert Annotations

When a budget alert is triggered, an annotation is added to the corresponding Cost Report. See the [Budget Alerts](/budgets#budget-alerts) documentation for details on how to set up budget alerts.
