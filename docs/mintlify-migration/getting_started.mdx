## Step 1: Create an Account

- To get started, [create a Vantage account](https://console.vantage.sh/signup).
- Optionally, you can upgrade to a paid plan to unlock additional features and track higher amounts of cloud infrastructure costs. View the [Vantage Pricing page](https://www.vantage.sh/pricing) for all pricing and plan details. All paid plans have an option to trial the service before committing to a subscription.

## Step 2: Connect Providers

Next, create a data integration between at least one of your providers and Vantage. Detailed integration documentation is linked for each of the providers below.

<Note>
**OTHER PROVIDERS**

Vantage will be launching support for additional cloud infrastructure providers in the future. If you have a particular provider that you would like supported, please reach out to [support@vantage.sh](mailto:support@vantage.sh).
</Note>

## Step 3: View Ingested Costs and Create Cost Reporting Resources

Once you create some provider integrations, Vantage will automatically begin ingesting billing information for your account. The default landing page in the Vantage console is the [**Overview**](/overview) page. This page serves as an executive-level summary, providing a comprehensive snapshot of the cost metrics that matter most to you.

As you continue to set up your cost reporting infrastructure, you can use the below guides for some best practices in Vantage.

- [**Team Accountability**](/team_accountability): To ensure team accountability in cloud cost management, follow this guide. Create Cost Report Folders for specific teams, generate Cost Reports for various dimensions, implement Report Notifications, set team budgets, and continually monitor and optimize to minimize unnecessary expenses, thus guaranteeing efficient cloud spending.
- [**Executive Reporting**](/executive_reporting): If you want to set up executive-level reporting, follow this guide. Use tools in Vantage to effortlessly gather and present comprehensive insights into your organization's cloud spending, enabling you to deliver actionable reports that facilitate informed decision-making at the executive level.
- [**Find Hidden Costs**](/hidden_costs): If you want to uncover hidden costs and optimize spending, follow this guide. Vantage provides tools like Active Resources for listing cost-driving resources and Cost Anomaly Alerts to automatically detect and alert on unexpected expenses.
