## Connect Your Fastly Account

### Prerequisites

[Create a free Vantage account](https://console.vantage.sh/signup), then follow the steps below to create a Fastly API token.

<Steps>
    <Step>
    Navigate and log in to the [Fastly console](https://www.fastly.com/).
    </Step>
    <Step>
    On the [**API tokens** page](https://manage.fastly.com/account/personal/tokens), re-enter your password if prompted. Then, click **\+ Create Token**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Enter the following token details:
    - For **Name**, enter something relevant, like *VantageReadOnlyToken*.
    - For **Type**, select **Automation token**.
    - If the **Role** option is displayed, select **Billing**.
    - For **Scope**, select **Read-only access (`global:read`) â€” Read account information configuration and stats**. Ensure all other options remain unchecked. Vantage will never attempt to make changes to your Fastly infrastructure.

    </Step>
</Steps>

### Create the Connection

<Steps>
    <Step>
    From the Vantage console, navigate to the [Fastly Settings page](https://console.vantage.sh/settings/fastly).
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Add API Token**, then paste the API token you just generated.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Connect account**. Vantage will automatically begin ingesting and visualizing your costs within the Vantage console. It should take about an hour for cost data to populate.
    </Step>

### Next Steps: Manage Workspace Access

Once your costs are imported, select which workspaces this integration is associated with. See the [Workspaces](/workspaces#manage-workspace-provider-integrations) documentation for information.

## Data Refresh

See the [provider data refresh documentation](/provider_data_refresh) for information on when data for each provider refreshes in Vantage.

- Account (account name)
- Category (e.g., CDN Data Transfer)
- Subcategory (e.g., CDN Requests)
- Resource (service resource ID)
- Region (e.g., Usa)
- Charge Type (e.g., Usage)
- Service (e.g., CDN)
