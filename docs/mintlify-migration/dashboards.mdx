title: "Dashboards"
description: "Dashboards contain widgets, like reports. You can apply date range and period filters (e.g., display daily costs) to all reports on the dashboard. A consistent date range across all reports on the dashboard can help with cost comparison between different reports. Once a dashboard is created, you can customize the widgets on your dashboard according to your preferences."

## Add a Saved Filter to a Dashboard

You can use [saved filters](/saved_filters) to apply consistent filter logic to multiple Cost Reports on a dashboard. If you have a dashboard of high-level Cost Reports (e.g., filtered only to connected providers or services), and you want to further filter a dashboard to a team or specific category, you can use saved filters on dashboards to quickly apply this logic.

<Steps>
    <Step>
    From the top right of any dashboard, click the **Saved Filters** dropdown menu.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Select one or more saved filters. The filter logic is applied across all Cost Reports on the dashboard.
    <Info>
    **NOTE**

    When you add a saved filter to a dashboard, if a preexisting filter on a Cost Report and the saved filter use the same provider (e.g., both use AWS), "AND" logic is used between each filter set (i.e., show costs where the preexisting filter AND saved filter are true). If the preexisting filter and saved filter use different providers, “OR” logic is used between each filter set.
    </Info>
    </Step>
</Steps>


## Set a Default Dashboard

You can set a default dashboard that's displayed when a user logs in to Vantage and visits `console.vantage.sh`, instead of the [Overview](/overview) screen. This default dashboard can be set for a team or by an individual user. When the user logs in to Vantage, they will be redirected to that dashboard, and will be in the [workspace](/workspaces) that is associated with that dashboard.

<Info>
**NOTE**

- If a user is a member of a team with a configured default dashboard and also has a personal dashboard configured, the personal dashboard is displayed.
- If a user is a member of two different teams with configured default dashboards, the user will see the default dashboard of the first team they were added to.
</Info>
