<Tip>
**TIP**

If you need help constructing a VQL query, navigate to the [**Network Flow Reports**](https://console.vantage.sh/network_flow_log_reports) page and click **New Network Flow Report**. From the top left, open the **Filters** menu. Create a filter and click the **View as VQL** button at the top of the **Filters** menu to see a filter's VQL representation. You can copy this syntax to use within your API calls.

## Network Flow Reports VQL Schema

VQL for Network Flow Reports comprises one namespace, `network_flow_logs`, which represents the available [filters](/network_flow_reports#filter-and-group-a-network-flow-report) on Network Flow Reports in the Vantage console. To reference a filter, use the following syntax: `namespace.field` (e.g., `network_flow_logs.account_id`). The following fields are available within the `network_flow_logs` namespace.

### Keywords

VQL includes a set of keywords to create complex filter conditions. These keywords function similar to their SQL equivalents. Note that each expression started with `provider = 'aws'`, followed by additional filters.

| Keyword | Description | VQL Sample | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `AND` | Logical AND operator | `(network_flow_logs.account_id = '123456789012') AND (network_flow_logs.dsthostname = 'datadoghq.com')` | This example filters for a specific account and destination hostname, where both conditions must be true. |
| `OR` | Logical OR operator | `(network_flow_logs.account_id = '123456789012') AND (network_flow_logs.dsthostname = 'datadoghq.com') OR (network_flow_logs.account_id = '09876543212') AND (network_flow_logs.dsthostname = 'github.com')` | This example looks for results associated with two accounts and destination hostnames. At least one condition must be true. |
| `!=` | Is not | `(network_flow_logs.dsthostname != 'github.com')` | This example looks for results that are any destination hostname type except for `github.com`. |
| `IN` and `NOT IN` | Used to compare against an array/list | `(network_flow_logs.peer_regions IN ('us-east-1','us-west-2'))` | This example searches for results within a set of regions.      This same query also works for `NOT IN` where the results are anything matching everything except for these regions: `(network_flow_logs.peer_regions NOT IN ('us-east-1','us-west-2'))`. |
| `LIKE` and `NOT LIKE` | Performs string comparisons | `(network_flow_logs.az_id LIKE '%use1%')` | This example selects data where the Availability Zone contains `use1`, such as `use1-az1`.      This same query also works for `NOT LIKE` where data does not contain a particular string: `(network_flow_logs.az_id NOT LIKE '%use1%')`. |

With these operators and keywords, you can construct complex filter conditions in VQL.

### Multiple Filters

Complex filter that shows combining two different statements using `OR` with multiple criteria.

(network_flow_logs.dsthostname = 'datadoghq.com') AND (network_flow_logs.account_id = '1234354678901') OR (network_flow_logs.dsthostname = 'github.com') AND (network_flow_logs.account_id = '90876543211')
