<Tip>
**GETTING STARTED**

If you are interested in this functionality, contact [partnerships@vantage.sh](/). Your Vantage account will be set up to include a Vantage for MSPs administrative portal.

If you already have separate accounts for your customers in Vantage and want to consolidate them to this model, contact [support@vantage.sh](/).
</Tip>

## Terms to Know

The following terms are used throughout this documentation.

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| **Managed Account** | A customer account that is provisioned and administered by an MSP. Managed Accounts have full access to Vantage features but cannot manage their own subscription. |
| **Management Account** | The MSP’s central administrative account used to create and oversee customers' Managed Accounts, manage billing rules, and configure integrations. |
| **Manager User** | A user from the MSP’s organization who accesses a customer's Managed Account. This user will inherit their role from their user in the Management Account. When logged in to a Managed Account, the Manager User sees visual indicators showing they are acting on behalf of the customer. |

## Partner Settings

The **Partner Settings** section in Vantage has two different sections: **Managed Accounts** and **Billing Rules**.

- The **Managed Accounts** screen is the central administrative portal that MSPs can use to perform the following actions:
	- Create new customer Managed Accounts and update their name/contact email
	- Delete existing customer Managed Accounts
	- Log in to a customer’s Managed Account
	- Add integrations on behalf of a customer’s Managed Account
	- Assign billing rules to a customer’s Managed Account
- On the **Billing Rules** screen, you can create custom billing adjustments, one-time charges, re-rating, and MSP-level discounts. See the [Billing Rules](/partners#billing-rules) section for additional information.

## Create a New Customer Managed Account

A customer Managed Account functions just like a regular Vantage account; however, customers cannot view or manage subscriptions to Vantage. All Vantage features, like reports, SSO, and Slack/MS Teams integrations, are available and scoped to each customer Managed Account.

To provision a new customer Managed Account:

<Steps>
    <Step>
    Log in to your Vantage for MSPs Management Account.
    </Step>

    <Step>
    From the top navigation, click **Settings**.
    </Step>

    <Step>
    From the left navigation, under **Partner Settings**, select **Managed Accounts.**
    </Step>

    <Step>
    The **Managed Accounts** administrative portal is displayed. All existing customer accounts are displayed along with the **Account Name**, **Contact Email**, and the date when the account was created. At the top, click **New Managed Account**.

    <Frame>
    ![Managed accounts screen with two existing accounts](https://assets.vantage.sh/docs/partners/managed-screen.png)
    </Frame>
    </Step>

    <Step>
    Enter an **Account Name** and a **Contact Email Address**. The email address is your administrator ID for this account and therefore must match your company's email domain. The email address cannot exist for another customer's Managed Account; however, an alias is acceptable, like `admin+customer@yourdomain.com`.

    <Frame>
    ![Pop-up window for creating a new managed account](https://assets.vantage.sh/docs/partners/new-account.png)
    </Frame>
    </Step>

    <Step>
    Click **Create Account**.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Role-Based Access Control

Access to Customer Managed Account is managed through [Role Based Access Control (RBAC)](/rbac). Users in the Management Account with the **Owner** role can set access to Managed Accounts, based on a user's team, following the steps below:

<Steps>
    <Step>
    From the top navigation, select **Settings**.
    </Step>

    <Step>
    Under **General Settings**, select **Teams**.
    </Step>

    <Step>
    Select the team you want to manage access for.
    </Step>

    <Step>
    Select the **Access** tab.
    </Step>

    <Step>
    In the **Managed Account Access** section, you can view a list of all Managed accounts. You can adjust a team's access accordingly based on the following options:
        - **Can Access**: Members of the team will be granted explicit access to the Managed Account.
        - **Cannot Access**: Members of the team will be explicitly denied access to this Managed Account.
        - **Inherit Access**: Access to the Managed Account will be determined by the Everyone Team.
    </Step>
</Steps>

If a user is a part of a Team that **Cannot Access** a Managed Account, they will be unable to access that Managed Account, even if they are granted **Can Access** permission via a different team. Users will maintain the same role that they have in the Management Account when they enter a Managed Account.

### Access Examples

*Example 1: Granting Access to a Managed Account*

Team A is assigned **Can Access** to the **Customer A** Managed Account.

**Result:** Any user that belongs to Team A can access the **Customer A** account with their existing role (e.g., Editor).

*Example 2: Denying Access Despite Other Permissions*

A user belongs to Team A with **Can Access** to the **Customer A** Managed Account.

The same user also belongs to Team B, which has **Cannot Access** to the **Customer A** account.

**Result:** The user cannot access the **Customer A** account because the explicit denial overrides all other access.

*Example 3: Using the Everyone Team for Inheritance*

The Everyone Team has **Can Access** to the **Customer A** Managed Account.

A new user is added to Team A, which has **Inherit Access** to the **Customer A** account.

**Result:** The user can access **Customer A** as it inherits access from Everyone Team.

### User Permissions

The following permissions apply based on a user's role.

|  | Owner | Integration Owner | Editor | Viewer |

## Access a Customer's Managed Account

From the **Managed Accounts** screen, you can move between each of your customers' Managed Accounts.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Enter Managed Account">
    Next to any Managed Account's name, click **Enter Account →**.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Access Customer Account">
    The Managed Account is displayed. When you enter a customer's account, you are considered the **Manager User** for that account.
        - A yellow bar is displayed around the border of the screen to indicate you are logged in to the Managed Account.
        - On the bottom left, a pop-up is displayed to indicate which Managed Account you are logged in to.

    <Frame>
    ![A bar is displayed around a customer's account that the manager user is logged into](https://assets.vantage.sh/docs/partners/customer-account.png)
    </Frame>

    Perform one of the following actions to return to your Management Account:

    - On the top right, click your user icon. Then, click **Return to MSP account**.
    - On the bottom left of the screen, click the **X** in the **Logged in as** pop-up.

    Once you are back in the Management Account, a confirmation message is displayed at the top.

    <Frame>
    ![Confirmation message that indicated you returned to the MSP account](https://assets.vantage.sh/docs/partners/green-bar.png)
    </Frame>
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Single Sign-On for Managed Accounts

After a Managed Account is created, you can enable Single Sign-On (SSO) for each Managed Account. Enter the Managed Account, then follow the instructions provided in the [SSO documentation](/sso) to enable SSO directly within the customer's Managed Account. Customers can also enable SSO directly from their own account. SSO is scoped to the Managed Account.

## Add Integrations to a Managed Account

The way you add integrations to a Managed Account depends on how your MSP is set up. There are two available workflows:

- **Workflow 1 - Unconsolidated Organizations:** An example MSP structure for this workflow might be where you have completely separate AWS Organizations set up for each customer. As an MSP, you have access to the payer account, and the customer has access to a member account. In this case, follow the steps below to ***Configure Integrations in the Managed Account***.
- **Workflow 2 - Consolidated Organizations:** In this setup, the MSP uses a single AWS Organization that includes multiple linked accounts under a centralized Management Account. In this case, follow the steps below to ***Configure Integrations in the Management Account***

### Configure Integrations in the Managed Account (Unconsolidated Organization Workflow, Most Common)

If this is the first time you are adding an integration:

<Steps>
    <Step>
    From the **Managed Accounts** screen, enter a customer’s account. If this is the first time you are connecting integrations for a customer, the **Connect Accounts** screen is displayed.
    </Step>

    <Step>
    Select an integration and follow the steps provided in the console.
    </Step>
</Steps>

</Frame>

If you are adding another integration:

<Steps>
    <Step>
        From the top navigation, select **Settings**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        On the right navigation, click **Integrations**. All available integrations are displayed. Select an integration to get started.
    </Step>
    </Steps>
<Tip>
**TIP**

See the [Quickstart](/getting_started) for a list of all other existing Vantage provider integrations, with links to each provider integration walkthrough.
</Tip>

### Configure Integrations in the Management Account (Consolidated Organization Workflow, Less Common)

This workflow requires that you first set up an integration in your MSP account. From the **Managed Accounts** screen, you can add any of your connected integrations to a Managed Account.

To get started, ensure that you have connected a provider integration to your Management Account. See the [AWS multiple accounts documentation](/connecting_aws#connecting-multiple-aws-accounts) for information on how to connect a Management Account with multiple linked accounts. Note that provider integrations passed down to customer Managed Accounts from an MSP's provider integrations will only be available in the first workspace of that customer. After you have connected an integration to your MSP account, follow the steps below to associate them with customer Managed Accounts.

<Steps>
    <Step>
    From the **Managed Accounts** screen, select a customer's account.
    </Step>

    <Step>
    Select the **Integrations** tab. All connected provider integrations for that customer are displayed. The account status, such as **Stable** or **Error**, is also displayed.
    </Step>

    <Step>
    To add a new connection, click **Connect** next to any listed provider.
    </Step>

    <Step>
    Select any of the listed provider accounts that you want to import data from.
    </Step>

    <Step>
    Click **Save**.
    </Step>
</Steps>

#### Customer Managed Account Integration View

When an MSP manages an integration in their MSP Management Account, a customer can view the managed integration's status. The customer cannot remove this type of integration.

<Steps>
    <Step>
    From a customer's account, click **Settings** in the top navigation.
    </Step>

    <Step>
    On the left navigation, under **MSP Settings**, click **Managed Integrations**.
    </Step>

    <Step>
    Any connected integrations managed by the MSP are displayed.
    </Step>
</Steps>

<Frame>

</Frame>

## Create Resources in a Managed Account

When you are logged in to a customer’s Managed Account, you can create Vantage resources, like Cost Reports, Virtual Tags, etc. For any resources, such as a Cost Report, that a Management Account user creates in a customer’s account, the **Created By** field displays the name **Manager User**.

<Frame>
![Resource in a customer's account with the Manager User as the creator](https://assets.vantage.sh/docs/partners/created-by.png)
</Frame>

## Billing Rules

Custom billing rules can be created in the Management Account and optionally applied to any of your customers’ Managed Accounts. The following billing rules are available:

- **Exclusion:** Exclusion of specific line items (such as EDP discounts)
- **Credits and Charges:** Additional charges or credits (such as one-time management fees)
- **Adjustment:** Three options are available:
	- **Per Service Adjustment:** Re-rating of existing services or categories (such as Amazon CloudFront data transfer charges).
	- **Re-Rate to Public Price:** Remove discounts and private pricing for a Managed Account (further described in the [section below](/partners#rerate-public))
	- **Remove SP/RI Discounts:** Re-rate any usage for a Managed Account that is covered by Reserved Instances or Savings Plans purchased in the AWS Payer account (further described in the [section below](/partners#remove-sp%2Fri-discounts-adjustment))
	- **Re-Rate Tiered Discounts:** Recalculate tiered pricing models for applicable services for a Managed Account (further described in the [section below](/partners#re-rate-tiered-discounts)).
- **Custom**: Custom Billing Rules allow you to craft your own billing rule using SQL based on logic you choose. This can be logic against any data within Vantage, or additinally any logic from the raw billing files from providers. At this time, only AWS is supported for applying logic to raw billing filles. Further information is available in the [section below](/partners#custom-billing-rules).

### Re-Rate to Public Pricing Adjustment

MSPs are often able to negotiate substantially higher Enterprise Discount Plans (EDPs) or Private Pricing Agreements (PPAs) from cloud providers based on the aggregate amount of usage across all of their customer base than what those customers would get if they were to purchase directly from a cloud provider. With the ability to re-rate to public pricing, you can revert your customers’ pricing back to list price, removing any enterprise discounts or private pricing.

When you apply the Re-rating to Public Pricing Billing rule adjustment, Vantage will re-map costs from `lineItem/UnblendedCost` to `pricing/publicOnDemandCost` from the AWS Cost and Usage Report. As a result, the following will apply in Vantage:

- **When you view your parent Management Account**, you will still see the price billed by AWS reflected, and the billing rule will not be applied. This enables margin analysis and understanding of where these commitments are applied.
- **When you view a customer’s Managed Account**, usage of services that are included in the billing rule will be presented at list price, with no indication that any price change was made on that usage.

### Remove SP/RI Discounts Adjustment

With discount toggling, you can decide which Reserved Instance and Savings Plan benefits your end customers receive. Use this adjustment billing rule to select whether any of your customer accounts receive discounts from commitments purchased in an AWS Payer account, or if such commitment covered usage should be reset back to list price. Any usage that is covered by a commitment purchased in an AWS Payer account will be reset to list price when you view usage in the customer’s Managed Account. This billing rule applies to any `SavingsPlanCoveredUsage` and `DiscountedUsage` usage types.

**Example Use Case**

You manage 20 customer AWS accounts and buy Savings Plans centrally. You want any of your customers to see only their own discounts. You set up and apply the **Remove SP/RI Discounts** adjustment to your customers’ Managed Accounts, ensuring any centrally purchased Savings Plans are excluded from customer billing.

- After the rule is applied, you will still see the cost that is billed by AWS in your parent Management Account to enable margin comparisons for end customers. In the visual example below, Savings Plan Covered Spend is still visible at the parent account level.
<Frame>
![Managed accounts screen with two existing accounts](https://assets.vantage.sh/docs/partners/msp-parent-discount-account.png)
</Frame>
- Vantage looks up the account that purchased the Committed Spend Discount, if that account is an AWS Payer account, Vantage removes the discount on any Cost and Usage line item from any customers’ Managed Accounts where the adjustment is enabled. The below visual example shows a customer’s Managed Account. When grouped by Charge Type, only the Usage and Tax charges are shown. The Usage amount of \$388.61 reflects the total list price of the usage, calculated by adding the parent account’s original Usage (\$173.14) and the Savings Plan Covered Spend (\$215.47) that would have otherwise reduced the cost.
<Frame>
![Managed accounts screen with two existing accounts](https://assets.vantage.sh/docs/partners/msp-child-discount-account.png)
</Frame>

### Re-Rate Tiered Discounts

MSPs often benefit from tiered pricing models offered by cloud providers, where unit costs decrease as usage increases. Since MSPs manage multiple customers, they can aggregate usage across all accounts to achieve lower pricing tiers that individual customers would not qualify for on their own. The **Re-Rate Tiered Discounts** billing rule allows you to re-rate customer usage back to what it would have cost without aggregated discounts to maintain more predictable pricing structures and margins.

With the **Re-Rating Tiered Discounts** Billing Rule adjustment, MSPs can ensure that each customer’s costs reflect only their own usage-based tiered pricing, rather than benefiting from the MSP’s aggregated tiered discounts. This allows MSPs to align customer pricing with what they would have paid if purchasing directly from the cloud provider. Additionally, MSPs can remove AWS free-tier benefits from newly created accounts.

When you apply adjustment, Vantage will re-calculate pricing tiers, on a per-customer level, and effectively reconstruct the pricing model based on each customer’s individual usage. Usage of a tiered service is recalculated for each customer’s Managed Account, and tiers are reapplied based on each customer’s usage. As a result, the following will apply in Vantage:

- **When you view your parent Management Account**, you will continue to see the original price billed by AWS, and the billing rule will not be applied. This enables margin analysis and helps MSPs track where discounts and commitments are applied.
- **When you view a customer’s Managed Account**, usage of services included in the billing rule will be presented at list price, with no indication that any adjustments were made on that usage.

This rule applies to the following services:

|  |  |
|------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Removal of tiered discounts** | • Amazon S3 <br/>• Amazon CloudFront |
| **Removal of tiered discounts** | Various services that fall under AWS's free tier, such as:<br/>• EC2 (t2.micro and t3.micro)<br/>• RDS (750 hrs per month)<br/>• S3 (5 GB per month)<br/><br/>For a full list of services, see the [AWS documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?gclid=Cj0KCQiA_NC9BhCkARIsABSnSTZ0_36nI3dLY14YSvLLWTz5Bigmycp0_8D-2t1HSqHi7ZxSUVWjCBIaArLSEALw_wcB&trk=578b2801-ffbb-4021-a1db-01a0bafb3a4a&sc_channel=ps&ef_id=Cj0KCQiA_NC9BhCkARIsABSnSTZ0_36nI3dLY14YSvLLWTz5Bigmycp0_8D-2t1HSqHi7ZxSUVWjCBIaArLSEALw_wcB:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!507162072479!p!!g!!aws!12563449882!121199905124&all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=*all&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=*all). |

### Custom Billing Rules

Custom Billing Rules in Vantage use SQL-like syntax to adjust cost data during ingestion. Apply defined pricing adjustments—such as markups, discounts, one-time fees, credits, or exclusions—using SQL statements against either raw provider cost files or processed Vantage cost data. For example, insert additional charges for premium services, update costs to reflect negotiated rates, or exclude unused resources altogether, based on your customer agreements.

<Info>
**NOTE**

Only the AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR) is supported for writing rules against provider cost files at this time. All CUR columns are made available for billing rules except `resource_tag_%` columns, which are AWS- and user-defined tag keys that are unique to each account.
</Info>

Sequencing multiple SQL rules lets you control the order in which cost adjustments are applied. Rules run in list order during each data ingestion cycle and modify the effective cost shown to end customers. The logic behind the rules remains hidden, allowing for consistent pricing without exposing internal calculations.

#### SQL Rule Structure

Use the `FROM` or `SET` clause to specify which dataset your rule targets (e.g., `FROM aws`):

| Dataset | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `aws` | Raw AWS CUR data. Rules written against `aws` only affect how data appears in Vantage and do **not** modify the original CUR file. |
| `costs` | Vantage-processed cost data. Use when inserting or adjusting normalized costs. |

Use the following SQL operations to define billing rules:

| Operation | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `UPDATE` | Adjust an existing cost value, such as applying a percentage discount. |
| `DELETE` | Remove specific line-items from being billed. |
| `INSERT` | Add new line-items, like charges or credits, into the `costs` dataset. |

When referencing columns, you must prefix them with the dataset name (e.g., `aws."lineItem/LineItemType"`).

Autocomplete is supported in the Vantage console. As you type, a list of available matching columns is displayed alongside your syntax. A complete list of available columns is also shown to the left of the SQL input field.

<Frame>
![Creating a custom billing rule](https://assets.vantage.sh/docs/partners/custom-billing-rule.png)
</Frame>

The following behaviors and limitations apply when creating and managing SQL billing rules in Vantage:

- **Validation:** Vantage automatically validates your SQL syntax and column names when you submit a rule. Errors are displayed in the UI.
- **Execution:** Rules are applied in the order listed. If you need multiple adjustments to the same item (e.g., a discount followed by a fee), create separate rules in sequence.
- **Date Logic:** Avoid using date logic in your SQL statement. Instead, use the rule’s `start_date` and `end_date` fields to define the application period. If SQL date conditions conflict with the rule's configured dates, the rule may not apply as expected.
- **Security:** SQL rules run in memory and are validated before execution. There is no risk of SQL injection or impact to your actual CUR data.
- **Limits:** Each workspace can define up to 20 billing rules. If you need more, contact [support@vantage.sh](/).

#### Example: Apply a Discount

The following example applies a 9.5% discount to all cost line items, except those related to credits, fees, AWS support, or marketplace purchases:

```bash
UPDATE aws
SET "lineItem/UnblendedCost" = aws."lineItem/UnblendedCost" * '0.095'
WHERE
aws."lineItem/ProductCode" != 'AwsPremiumSupport'
AND aws."lineItem/LineItemType" != 'Credit'
AND aws."lineItem/LineItemType" != 'Fee'
AND aws."bill/BillingEntity" != 'AWS Marketplace'
```

    <Step>
    Select the **Billings Rules** tab.
    </Step>

    <Step>
    Click **Assign a Billing Rule**.
    </Step>

    <Step>
    Select one or more billing rules and click **Save**. The billing rule is applied to the customer's costs. A customer will only be able to see credits and charges. Exclusions and adjustments are not shown in the customer view.

## Remove a Managed Account

You can either *unlink* or *delete* a customer’s account. MSP customers cannot delete accounts.

<Info>
**NOTE**

If you are a customer with a Managed Account and want your account deleted, contact your MSP.
</Info>

- If you want to only *unlink* an account, but not delete the account, contact [support@vantage.sh.](/) The account will still exist in Vantage.
- When an account is completely deleted, the account is unlinked from the MSP and also completely deleted from Vantage. To delete a customer's Managed Account, click the trash can icon next to the account name on the **Managed Accounts** screen.

<Warning>
**WARNING**

Deleting a customer's account is a **permanent action** and will remove any connected customer integrations.
