description: Report Notifications provide either daily, weekly, or monthly reports for one or more Cost Reports.
---

You can receive these notifications from the following methods:

- **Slack:** You can send a notification to one or more public or private channels in a Slack workspace.
- **Microsoft Teams:** You can send a notification to one or more public or private channels in a Microsoft Teams account.
- **Email:** You can send a notification to one or more email addresses.

<Info>
**NOTE**

You can create either a Slack integration or a Microsoft Teams integration, but not both.

Before any notification is sent, Vantage ensures it has the most up-to-date representation of your cost data to give you an accurate report.

## Report Notifications vs. Cost Anomaly Alerts vs. Cost Alerts

Vantage provides multiple ways to keep you informed about your cloud spend. Report Notifications offer a scheduled digest of individual reports and are sent on a recurring basis. [Cost Anomaly Alerts](/cost_anomaly_alerts) are sent once per day when costs exceed an anomaly threshold, based on a Vantage machine learning model. In contrast, [Cost Alerts](/cost_alerts) allow you to define custom thresholds for specific reports. They are triggered when your cost data meets the conditions youâ€™ve set.

## Set Up Slack Integration

See the [Slack](/slack) integration documentation for information on how to set up a connection. See the [Set Up Report Notifications](/report_notifications#create-notifications) section for instructions on how to set up notifications for specific reports.

## Set Up Microsoft Teams Integration

See the [Microsoft Teams](/microsoft_teams) integration documentation for information on how to set up a connection. See the [Set Up Report Notifications](/report_notifications#create-notifications) section for instructions on how to set up notifications for specific reports.

## Set Up Report Notifications

Once you have set up either a Slack or Microsoft Teams integration, follow the steps below to create Report Notifications.

If you instead want to create an email notification, the email report will contain a list of all of your views and a point-in-time cost for each view. The bottom of the email will include [cost recommendations](/cost_recommendations). Cost recommendations are not sent for Slack or Microsoft Teams alerts.
