You can use the [Vantage API](https://vantage.readme.io/reference/general) to programmatically access cloud pricing data.

Service tokens are associated with an account, not with an individual user. For Enterprise customers who use teams and role-based access control, you have the option of selecting a team to inherit permissions from.

To generate an API service token:

1. On the left navigation of the **Settings** screen, select **API Access Tokens**.
2. Enter a new token name, choose a team (if applicable), select the **Read** and/or **Write** scope, and click **Create**.
3. Click **Show** to reveal and copy your token.

To revoke a token, click **Delete**.

#### Create a Vantage API Personal Access Token {#api-personal-token}

Personal access tokens are associated with the user who created the token.

To generate an API personal access token:

1. On the left navigation of the **Settings** screen, select **API Access Tokens**, then navigate to the **Personal Access Tokens** tab.
2. Enter a new token name, select the **Read** and/or **Write** scope, and click **Create**.
3. Click **Show** to reveal and copy your token.

To revoke a token, click **Delete**.

## Personal Settings

From the top navigation bar of the Vantage console, click **Settings**. On the side navigation bar, review the options under **Personal Settings**.

### Update Your Profile

In the **Profile** section, you can change your display name as well as your email address. Note that changing your email will log you out and require you to re-confirm. You can also select a default dashboard that's displayed when you navigate to `console.vantage.sh`. See the [Default Dashboards](/dashboards#default-dashboard) documentation for details.
