# Vantage API

import CustomCardGroup from '@site/src/components/CustomCardGroup';
import CustomCard from '@site/src/components/CustomCard';

The Vantage API allows users to programmatically access their cost data as well as create cost resources, such as Cost Reports, Folders, Saved Filters, and Dashboards. 

You can access the [API documentation](https://vantage.readme.io/reference/general) to read more about available endpoints and associated endpoint parameters. You can also perform API calls directly from the documentation. 

:::caution Important
Keep in mind that when using the API reference tool to perform API calls, you are working with your live data.
:::

When viewing an endpoint, all available parameters will be listed on the corresponding API documentation page, along with any requirements.

The above image shows a sample `POST` call to the `/folders` endpoint. 
- To get started, enter your [API token](https://vantage.readme.io/reference/authentication) in the **Authorization** field. 
- The body parameters `title`, `parent_folder_token`, `saved_filter_token`, and `workspace_token` are displayed, along with a sample request. 
- You can choose to display the request in numerous programming languages, such as Python, Ruby, or JavaScript. 
- Click the **Try It!** button. The Response and any errors are displayed below the request. 

## API Versions

Two versions of the API are available in the documentation:

- `v1.1.0`: With v1 of the API, you can view providers (AWS only for this version), services, and products. You can also view Cost Reports. See the [v1 API documentation](https://vantage.readme.io/v1.1.0/reference/general) for more information. 
- `v2.0`: v2 of the API offers expanded functionality. You can automate the management and creation of Cost Reports, Folders, Dashboards, and Saved Filters. You can also create and manage teams and resource access grants. See the [v2 API documentation](https://vantage.readme.io/v2.0/reference/general) for more information.
