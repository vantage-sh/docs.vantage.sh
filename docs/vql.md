# VQL (Vantage Query Language)

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

The Vantage Query Language (VQL) is a SQL-like language for filtering cloud cost data. It includes a normalized schema across cloud providers and basic filter syntax for creating complex filters. VQL is currently available as part of the [Vantage API](https://vantage.readme.io/reference/general) as well as within the [Vantage Terraform provider](/terraform).

- **API**. On supported endpoints, such as `/cost_reports`, you can use VQL in the `filter` parameter to programmatically create and fetch Cost Reports. There are two VQL scopes currently available for Cost Reports and Resource Reports.
- **Terraform provider**. In supported Terraform resources, such as `vantage_saved_filter` or `vantage_cost_report`, you can use VQL for the `filter` argument to create filtered Cost Reports or saved filters.

The below examples show how to use VQL on both the API and on the Terraform provider. This example creates a [saved filter](/cost_reports#saved-filters) in your Vantage account using VQL.

## Key Concepts

VQL is based on the following key concepts, further described in subsequent sections.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="schema" label="Schema">

VQL uses a schema that organizes filters into namespaces. These namespaces comprise various fields that you can leverage to filter and retrieve specific cost-related data.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="keywords" label="Keywords">

VQL includes keywords, like `AND`, `OR`, `IN`, `LIKE`, and `NOT`, to create complex and precise filter conditions.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="syntax" label="Syntax">

VQL syntax closely resembles the `WHERE` clause of a SQL query. You can construct filter operations to extract desired cost insights.

## Scopes

VQL has a separate scope for each type of reportâ€”meaning that you cannot use VQL statements for Cost Reports when querying Resource Reports. See the following pages below to learn more about each VQL scope.

- [VQL for Cost Reports](/vql_cost_reports)
- [VQL for Resource Reports](/vql_resource_reports)
