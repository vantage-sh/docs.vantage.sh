# VQL for Cost Reports

This page describes how to use VQL when querying Cost Reports in API or using the Terraform Provider.

## Cost Reports VQL Schema

VQL comprises two namespaces: `costs` and `tags`, which represent the available [filters](/cost_reports#filtering-cost-reports) on Cost Reports in the Vantage console. To reference a filter, use the following syntax: `namespace.field` (e.g., `costs.provider` or `tags.name`).

## Keywords

VQL includes a set of keywords to create complex filter conditions. These keywords function similar to their SQL equivalents.

| Keyword | Description                           | VQL Sample                                                                          | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| `OR`    | Logical OR operator                   | `costs.provider = 'azure' OR costs.provider = 'aws'`                                | This example retrieves costs from either Azure or AWS. At least one condition must be true.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `IN`    | Used to compare against an array list | `costs.provider = 'azure' AND costs.account_id IN ('account-1', 'account-2')`       | This example filters based on a list of account IDs, returning data for the specified accounts<br/><br/>You can also use `IN` along with a special syntax for filtering by multiple tags. See [Filter by Multiple Tags](/vql#multiple-tags) for details.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `LIKE`  | Performs string comparisons           | `costs.provider = 'gcp' AND tags.name = 'environment' AND tags.value LIKE '%prod%'` | This example selects data where the tag value contains `prod`, such as `production-1`. <br /> Note that at this time, `LIKE` is not compatible with `costs.account_id`, `costs.provider_account_id`, `costs.region`, and `costs.service`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `NOT`   | Represents negation                   | `costs.provider = 'aws' AND costs.region NOT IN ('us-east-1', 'us-east-2')`         | This example filters out data from both specified regions, providing all AWS costs _not_ in these regions. Use `NOT IN` to specify a list of single or multiple values. <br/><br/> You can also use the `!=` or `<>` operators for "is not." <br/><br/> `costs.provider = 'aws' AND costs.region != 'us-east-1'`<br/><br/>You can use `NOT LIKE` to perform string comparisons:<br/><br/>`costs.provider = 'gcp' AND tags.name = 'environment' AND tags.value NOT LIKE '%prod%'` |

With these keywords, you can construct complex filter conditions in VQL, providing flexibility and precision when querying and analyzing cloud cost data.

## Syntax

You can think of VQL in its current iteration as the `WHERE` clause of a SQL query. By combining the schema and keywords above with parentheses, you can form complex filter operations, such as:

```sql
costs.provider = 'mongo' AND costs.allocation = 1.0 AND (costs.service = 'REALM' AND costs.resource_id IN ('s3')) OR (costs.provider = 'aws' AND costs.allocation = 1.0 AND costs.account_id IN ('123456798'))
```

## VQL Examples {#examples}

The following examples cover common use cases for VQL.

### Combining Providers {#providers}

:::note
To reference a [Custom Provider](/connecting_custom_providers) in VQL queries, navigate to the [**Integrations** page](https://console.vantage.sh/settings/custom_providers). Use the displayed **Provider ID** (e.g., `custom_provider:accss_crdntl_123a45bfdaf38765`).
:::

Filter for provider costs associated with either MongoDB Atlas or AWS.

```sql
costs.provider = 'mongo' OR costs.provider = 'aws'
```

### Cost Allocation {#cost-allocation}

Set cost allocation to `0.5`.

```sql
costs.provider = 'gcp' AND costs.allocation = 0.5
```

### Costs from a List of Regions {#region}

Filter for Snowflake costs in two regions. Note that you will need to use the region code, such as `us-east-1` in the case of AWS, or `AWS_US_EAST_1` in the case of Snowflake, below.

```sql
costs.provider = 'snowflake' AND costs.region IN ('AWS_US_EAST_1', 'AWS_US_EAST_2')
```

### Get Marketplace Transactions {#marketplace}

Retrieve costs associated with the AWS Marketplace.

```sql
costs.provider = 'aws' AND costs.marketplace = true
```

### Costs by Account ID {#account}

Costs for a specific set of services and account ID.

```sql
costs.provider = 'aws' AND costs.account_id = '123456758' AND costs.service IN ('Amazon Relational Database', 'Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud - Compute')
```

### Costs by Provider Account ID {#provider-account}

The following example represents costs from a specific AWS billing account or costs from a specific Azure subscription.

```sql
(costs.provider = 'aws' AND costs.provider_account_id = 'abcd1234') OR (costs.provider = 'azure' AND costs.provider_account_id = 'abcd1234')
```

### Per-Resource Costs and Costs by Service {#resource}

Resource costs require both `provider` and `service` in addition to the `resource_id`.

```sql
costs.provider = 'aws' AND costs.service = 'Amazon Relational Database Service' AND costs.resource_id = 'arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:123456789:db:primary-01'
```

#### Multiple Resource IDs

```sql
costs.provider = 'aws' AND costs.service = 'Amazon Relational Database Service' AND costs.resource_id IN ('arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:123456789:db:primary-01', 'arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:123456789:db:primary-02')
```

### Costs by Specific Category {#category}

Filter costs to see a specific cost category. Category costs require both `provider` and `service` as well as `category`.

```sql
costs.provider = 'fastly' AND costs.service = 'CDN' AND costs.category = 'Data Transfer'
```

### Costs by Specific Subcategory {#subcategory}

Filter costs by a specific service and subcategory. Subcategory costs require both `provider` and `service` as well as `subcategory`.

```sql
costs.provider = 'aws' AND costs.service = 'AWS Certificate Manager' AND costs.subcategory = 'USE1-PaidPrivateCA'
```

### Cost by Charge Type {#charge-type}

Filter costs by a specific charge type.

```sql
costs.provider = 'aws' AND costs.charge_type = 'Usage'
```

### Filter by Tag {#tags}

#### Filter by Single Tag

Filter costs based on a specific tag, such as `environment`, with the value `production`, in AWS.

```sql
costs.provider = 'aws' AND tags.name = 'environment' AND tags.value = 'production'
```

#### Filter for Multiple Values from a Single Tag Key

If you want to filter for multiple tag values that are tied to one tag key (e.g., costs tagged with the `team` tag of `mobile` and `data`), use the below syntax.

```sql
costs.provider = 'aws' AND tags.name = 'team' AND tags.value IN ('mobile', 'data')
```

#### Filter by Multiple Tags {#multiple-tags}

If you want to filter for resources that have more than one tag associated, you can use the syntax shown in the example below.

```sql
costs.provider = 'aws' AND (tags.name, tags.value) IN (('environment', 'staging'), ('team', 'engineering'))
```

This example filters for resources that are tagged with the `environment` tag with a value of `staging` as well as the `team` tag with a value of `engineering`. This filter is the same as creating the following manual filter in the console.

<div style={{display:"flex", justifyContent:"center"}}>
    <img alt="Filter by multiple tags in the console" width="80%" src="/img/multiple-tags-example.png" />
</div>

#### Filter for Matching Tags Using `LIKE`

```sql
costs.provider = 'azure' AND tags.name = 'environment' AND tags.value LIKE '%prod%'
```

### Filter for Untagged Resources {#untagged}

On providers that have a **Not Tagged**/**Not Labeled** filter option in the console, you can use the below VQL to see untagged resources. This example looks for untagged resources in a multi-cloud environment.

```sql
(costs.provider = 'aws' AND tags.name = NULL) OR (costs.provider = 'azure' AND tags.name = NULL) OR (costs.provider = 'gcp' AND tags.name = NULL)
```

## Troubleshooting

If you are receiving an error when trying to complete a query, check the following troubleshooting tips below.

- Each provider exposes certain names to the API. Those names are normalized within the schema. Check the [Data Dictionary](/data_dictionary) for normalized field names.
- Query parameter values should be wrapped in single quotes.
