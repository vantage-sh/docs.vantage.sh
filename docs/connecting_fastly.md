# Fastly

Vantage integrates with your Fastly account through a read-only API token. Fastly API tokens are free for you to create, and adding them to the Vantage console takes only a few minutes.

## Connect Your Fastly Account

### Prerequisites

[Create a free Vantage account](https://console.vantage.sh/signup), then follow the steps below to create a Fastly API token.

1. Navigate and log in to the [Fastly console](https://www.fastly.com).
2. On the [**API tokens** page](https://manage.fastly.com/account/personal/tokens), re-enter your password if prompted. Then, click **+ Create Token**.
3. Enter the following token details:
   - For **Name**, enter something relevant, like _VantageReadOnlyToken_.
   - For **Type**, select **Automation token**.
   - If the **Role** option is displayed, select **Billing**.
   - For **Scope**, select **Read-only access (`global:read`) â€” Read account information configuration and stats**. Ensure all other options remain unchecked. Vantage will never attempt to make changes to your Fastly infrastructure.
   - For **Access**, select **All Services on YOUR_ORGANIZATION_NAME**.
   - For **Expiration**, select **Never expire**.

   </details>
4. Click **Create Token**, and re-enter your password if prompted. Fastly will generate your API token. Copy this token for the next steps.

### Create the Connection

1. From the Vantage console, navigate to the [Fastly Settings page](https://console.vantage.sh/settings/fastly).
2. Click **Add API Token**, then paste the API token you just generated.
3. Click **Connect account**. Vantage will automatically begin ingesting and visualizing your costs within the Vantage console. It should take about an hour for cost data to populate.

### Next Steps: Manage Workspace Access

Once your costs are imported, select which workspaces this integration is associated with. See the [Workspaces](/workspaces#integration-workspace) documentation for information.

## Data Refresh

See the [provider data refresh documentation](/provider_data_refresh) for information on when data for each provider refreshes in Vantage.

## Fastly Reporting Dimensions

On Fastly [Cost Reports](/cost_reports), you can filter across several dimensions:

- Account (account name)
- Category (e.g., CDN Data Transfer)
- Subcategory (e.g., CDN Requests)
- Resource (service resource ID)
- Region (e.g., Usa)
- Charge Type (e.g., Usage)
- Service (e.g., CDN)
- Tag ([virtual tags](/tagging) created in Vantage for this provider)
