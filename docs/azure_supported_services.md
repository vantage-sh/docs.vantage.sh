# Azure Services & Regions

## Support Services

Vantage will show 100% of your organization's accrued costs across all services. We also offer per-resource pricing for the following services using custom logic to query APIs for each individual Azure service. While we support per-resource pricing for the most popular services, we do not offer support for all Azure services by default.

:::note
To request new service support on Vantage, please email [support@vantage.sh](mailto:support@vantage.sh) with the subject line "New Azure Service Support." Please include a detailed description about what information you'd like to see.
